## Life

I have a deep passion for sports, particularly football and grappling martial arts. I practiced Judo for 10 years, starting at the age of 9, and earned my black belt in 2019. Although I've taken a break from combat sports, I plan to return to them eventually.

Currently, I'm a dedicated gym-goer and an aspiring marathon runner.

Originally from Cyprus, I now reside in Edinburgh, Scotland. I love traveling and have explored many countries, including the UK, Greece, Spain, Italy, Germany, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary and more.
